Goal: use d3 with react-redux to display data.gov api information. Specifically used emissions data from https://www.eia.gov/opendata/qb.php?category=2251670.

Highlighted technologies include d3, topojson, react-redux, webpack, and express.

Completed: 15 hours( inlcudes manual edit of topo-json to include seven displayed states statistics)

Issues: found limited ability to integrate react-redux store data into d3 display. After base of desired project was attained (data changes on year click, hover over bubble displays data), abandoned for a more react-redux flexible data visualization.
